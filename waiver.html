          assignees, heirs, parents, guardians, and legal representatives hereby
          voluntarily indemnify, release from liability, and agree to defend and
          hold harmless SacHacks and its officers, directors, trustees,
          employees, faculty, staff, agents, representatives, and any
          department, organization or group affiliated therewith (collectively
          “the Releasees”) from any and all claims which may arise from any
          cause whatsoever, regardless of the source, and for any accident,
          injury, illness, death, loss, damage to person or property, or other
          consequences arising or resulting directly or indirectly from
          participation in the Program, including while traveling for the
          Program, and including but not limited to claims arising from or
          related to SacHacks negligence, if any.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participant hereby represents and warrants that they are and will be
          covered throughout the Program by a policy of comprehensive health and
          accident insurance which provides coverage for injuries and illnesses
          that Participant sustains or experiences while participating in the
          Program. In the event that Participant is injured, Participant agrees
          to assume any financial obligation, either through Participant’s
          insurance, or through some other means, for any medical costs which
          Participant incurs. The Releasees assume no responsibility for any
          medical expenses, injury, or damage suffered by Participant in
          connection with the Program.
        </p>
        <p>
          BY CHECKING THE TYPEFORM SACHACKS WAIVER QUESTION I AGREE BOX,
          PARTICIPANT EXPRESSLY ASSUMES ALL RISK OF PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH, OR
          PROPERTY DAMAGE UPON HIMSELF/HERSELF, TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE SACHACKS
          RELEASEES, AND TO EXEMPT AND RELIEVE THE SACHACKS RELEASEES FROM ANY
          AND ALL LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR WRONGFUL
          DEATH.
        </p>
        <p>
          By checking the box and completing registration for the Program,
          Participant waives their right to bring any legal action now or at any
          time in the future to recover compensation or obtain any other remedy
          for any injury to them or their property or for their death, however
          caused, arising out of their participation in the Program. Participant
          further agrees that Participant, their spouse (if any), assignees,
          heirs, parents, guardians, and legal representatives will not make any
          claim against, sue or attach the property of the Releasees for any

        <p>
          Participant, or Legal Guardian of Participant, is aware of the
          potential dangers incident to engaging in the Program, that this is a
          release of liability, a waiver of the Participant’s legal right to
          collect damages in the event of injury, death or property damage, and
          a contract between Participant and the Releasees, and Participant or
          their Legal Guardian signs it of their own free will. Participant, or
          Legal Guardian of Participant, expressly agrees that this release is
          intended to be as broad and inclusive as the State of California will
          allow and that if any portion is held invalid, agrees that the balance
          shall, not withstanding, continue in full force and effect.
